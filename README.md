# Problem
Education in the jet age is driven by information, and the internet as we know is filled a lot of unreliable information
which students consider in making decisions. Undergraduates joining the workforce lack some of the skill set required 
and so have a hard timing adjusting to the expectations required of them.

# Proposed Solution
A platform to connect students from various instituions to foster collaboration and share information
on emerging trends in different fields of study etc. This platform will provide guidance to students on course
selection, internship positions, scholarship opportunitues etc.

# Proposed Stack
Java Android, PHP, MySQL

# Benefits
 - Improve collaboration of students on research, competions.
 - Access to reliable information of scholarships, admissions and internship opportunities.
 - Provide information on career opportunities and the skillset required to meet the workforce demand.
